## My process

  First step of the creation is analyze and I follow it too. I Analyze how could I break this page into different section maintaining the sementics and accessibility. I wrote down the way to organize my HTML which made the markup process really fast I had not to revisit the HTML while styling the page. I styled all the section to make them as close as I can to resemble the given design of the page. I am hopefull to improve my skills and continue to polish my coding and structuring techniques.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In designing the page I came across the problem where I struct how to maintain the both desing and sementics at the same time. In my project, I faced a challenge with the display of a <dl> (definition list) containing <dt> (definition term) and <dd> (definition description). By default, browsers display <dt> and <dd> as block-level elements, causing <dd> to appear on a new line below <dt>. However, I needed <dt> and <dd> to flow naturally in the same line while keeping the structure semantically correct and accessible.

To solve the problem:
 - I applied display: none to <dt> to visually hide it while keeping it accessible for screen readers.
 - I added a <span> inside <dd> to display the term (e.g., "Step 1:") in the flow of the description.
 - I styled the <span> using CSS to resemble the hidden <dt>'s purpose while maintaining control over the visual presentation.

Here is code to solve the above problem
```html
<section class="intructions">
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <dl>

        <div>
          <dt>Beat the eggs:</dt>
          <dd><span role="none">Beat the eggs:</span>In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a
            tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</dd>
        </div>

        <div>
          <dt>Heat the pan:</dt>
          <dd><span role="none">Heat the pan:</span>Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</dd>
        </div>

        <div>
          <dt>Cook the omelette:</dt>
          <dd><span role="none">Cook the omelette:</span>Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure
            the eggs evenly coat the surface.</dd>
        </div>

        <div>
          <dt>Add fillings (optional):</dt>
          <dd><span role="none">Add fillings:</span>When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen
            fillings over one half of the omelette.</dd>
        </div>

        <div>
          <dt>Fold and serve:</dt>
          <dd><span role="none">Fold and serve:</span>As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the
            fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</dd>
        </div>

        <div>
          <dt>Enjoy:</dt>
          <dd><span role="none">Enjoy:</span>Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</dd>
        </div>
      </dl>
</section>
```
```css

.intructions dl{
    counter-reset: instruction-counter;
    padding-left: 8px ;
    margin-top: 12px;
}

.intructions dl > div{
    counter-increment: instruction-counter;
    display: flex;
    align-items: flex-start;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}

.intructions  dt{
    display: none;
}

.intructions dl div dd span{
    font-weight: bold;
    color: var(--stone-600);
    margin-right: 5px;
}

.intructions dl  div::before{
    content: counter(instruction-counter) ".";
    margin-right: 12px;
    font-weight: 700;
    color: var(--rose-800);
}
```

### Continued development

I will countinue to develope a few more HTML and CSS dedicated project before going deep into the JS. Then explore the libraries like the React and Three JS although I already have skilled in these but I lack confidence because of not making the projects consistently. There is the tip for the new comming to remain consistent and make the projects to polish their skills
